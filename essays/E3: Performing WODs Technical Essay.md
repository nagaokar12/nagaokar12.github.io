#### Invoice 1
Here is the [link](https://dport96.github.io/ITM352/morea/060.expressions-operators/experience-invoice1.html) to the WOD for Invoice 1. Invoice 1 was a WOD that required us to create a sales receipt and print our calculations of the subtotal of items purchased (quantity of items purchased multipled by the item's unit price), and the tax at a rate of 5.75% for a total.

#### Answers
When performing this WOD, I thought it would be one of the more difficult ones, since we had build the HTML file from scratch rather than copying it like we did with the previous couple of WODs. It wasn't too bad because I could copy and paste, but one of the errors I made when copy and pasting was not changing the number inside the variables. That in turn, affected my entire file and I ended up taking some time that could've possibly changed my time from Av to Rx. 

I'm not sure if I did anything to prepare for the WOD, but I think preparing for and doing Labs 5 and 6 helped improved my knowledge of what to do before I started the WOD. Knowing what to do with the table (I just copied and pasted the page source) from Lab 6 probably cut down my time on this WOD by at least half an hour, and knowing how to declare the variables before. 

I suppose I could've perhaps re-read my notes or any of the pre-assignment notes right before doing the WOD. I think the one thing I would have to work on is my time management, since I submitted the WOD right before the due date and I'm writing this essay immediately after as well. I also have to redo other WODs in order to get full credit as well, so I think I would've like to complete this one earlier.
