I thought BrowserHistory1 was quite easy to follow, even though it was probably the most time-consuming of the three browser history assignments. That was the only one of the three for me that I got on the first attempt. The readings were really helpful with helping me complete the first BrowserHistory. I think the hardest thing for me was just figuring where to place the text links to external pages, but I just put them where I thought they were best. I don't remember exactly how long it took me to complete the first one, I believe it was in the 13-to-14 minute range though. 

BrowserHistory2 and BrowserHistory3 were the ones that were more challenging for me. Although I was able to continue using knowledge I got from the readings, I ended up giving up on the first tries for both after reaching the DNF level. I thought that I got it on the first tries, but it wasn't loading properly on the server. I then proceeded to watch the screencasts and fixing a couple errors, it still wasn't loading. After awhile on BrowserHistory2, and reloading BrowserHistory3 on the local IP address rather than "localhost", everything showed up. I had the same problem on my rerun too, so my times were a lot slower than they should've. I still have no idea what led to this, and I'm still trying to figure that out now. 

For me, the hardest part of BrowserHistory2 was implementing the texts. That was one of the things that didn't load, so after watching the screencast, I ended up having to copy the links for the Oswald and Open Sans fonts (I'm not sure if I had to for the Open Sans, but I did anyway), and eventually it turned out okay. I also had issues with making the font colors dark blue on the page even though I set it, but it somehow worked itself together after shutting everything down and restarting it. I stopped the recording at 17 minutes, but on an unrecorded time, I got it in about 12 minutes, but had to restart the server as previously mentioned.

The harder part for me in BrowserHistory3 was trying to align the three browser descriptions. Again, after watching the screencast, I thought I figured it out and again, this was another thing that didn't load on the server but later loaded without me making changes. I also had to add the paddings after watching the screencasts, so on that second attempt, I got it in about 12 to 13 minutes.

If I have to give advice on this, I would follow that instruction to do it before watching the screencast. It helps if you get it on the first try so that you're not as frustrated, but it seems necessary to find your mistakes first and learn from them. Also, if it's not clear; watch the screencast. There was a ton of information to take from them.
