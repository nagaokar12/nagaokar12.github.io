I thought BrowserHistory1 was quite easy to follow, even though it was probably the most time-consuming of the three browser history assignments. That was the only one of the three for me that I got on the first attempt. The readings were really helpful with helping me complete the first BrowserHistory. I think the hardest thing for me was just figuring where to place the text links to external pages, but after looking at Wikipedia pages, it was pretty good. 

BrowserHistory2 and BrowserHistory3 were the ones that were more challenging for me. I ended up giving up on the first tries for both after reaching the DNF level. I thought that I got it on the first tries, but it wasn't loading properly on the server. I then proceeded to watch the screencasts and fixing a couple errors, it still wasn't loading. After awhile on BrowserHistory2, and reloading BrowserHistory3 on the local IP address rather than "localhost", everything showed up. I had the same problem on my rerun too, so my times were a lot slower than they should've. I still have no idea what led to this, and I'm still trying to figure that out now. 

If I have to give advice on this, I would follow that instruction to do it before watching the screencast. It helps if you get it on the first try so that you're not as frustrated, but it seems necessary to find your mistakes first and learn from them.
