Prior to becoming a MIS major, I was a civil engineering major. However, it took me about three semesters for me to realize that it wasn't for me so I decided to find something that would interest me. I decided to pursue a degree somewhere in the business field after my supervisor at the on-campus job in a business office I worked at encouraged me to try and push for going into Shidler. I thought she was right, considering that I found the environment I worked in incredible and that the work interested me, even though it was low-level stuff. I still didn't know what I wanted to do once I got to Shidler until I had to attend a mandatory meeting where they went over all of the majors. It was as each major was being pitched by a faculty member that I decided that MIS was something I wanted to do, as coding was something that intrigued me when I took it as an engineering major and later when I was experimenting with classes.
