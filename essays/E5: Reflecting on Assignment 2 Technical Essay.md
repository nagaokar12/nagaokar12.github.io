#### 1. Provide a brief introduction to the assignment along with a link to this page for further details
[Assignment 2](https://dport96.github.io/ITM352/morea/150.Assignment2/experience-Assignment2.html) involved ordering items, then going through a login and registration page for a user to register before redirecting to the invoice. There were also guards that needed to be made in order for no one to go straight to the invoice.

#### 2. What did you learn from this assignment?
I learned what not to do, and to start as soon as possible. I also learned how to process data from login and registration for a user as well. Overall, I have a better understanding of reading and writing files.

#### 3. Did you work with a partner? Assign an estimated percentage on the amount each team member contributed to the assignment (including yourself).
I did not work with a partner.

#### 4. How did you get help when you needed it? What did you need help with?
I asked Professor Port for help when I needed it. I needed help with a lot of things, like setting up my permissions for my user_data.json, getting my login and registration pages working and saving the data inside of the query.

#### 5. How was developing this assignment different than assignment #1?
This assignment was different because I had to create codes that read files as well as code that added to files. I also had to create security measures that prevented people from going directly to pages. 

#### 6. Estimate the % of time you spent (a) thinking about how to do something, (b) writing code (but do not include testing, (c) testing and debugging
I estimate that I spent about 10% about how to do something, 75% to write code, and about 15% testing and debugging. The writing really got to me, and fortunately, Professor Port was willing to meet up to help me solve issues.

#### 7. Describe what worked well with this project? What did not work well?
##### What worked well:
The product pages and invoice seemed to work well. The login page seemed to work right away as well. I like how everything redirected to the correct pages smoothly as well, so that was something I considered to work well too.

##### What did not work well:
Looking at and modifying code without understanding it hurt me. Having to explain it provided me with a good explanation, but it took too long. In terms of code, saving the data in the registration page after making an error and then solving the error hurt. It baffled both me and Professor Port, and we spent a lot of time trying to figure it out. 

#### 8. If you could go back in time and do things differently, what would you do differently?
I think I would start earlier as well as ask for help. Time is such a crucial factor in making sure this goes right, and I ended up having to use an extra day past the deadline to
